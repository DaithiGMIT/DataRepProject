# Data Representation and Querying Project 2022

In this project I created an app to read an online database of albums and diplay them in the app.
The app aslo allows you to add new albums to the database, edit existing albums and also delete them.
The App Uses Client side routing and it's own server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## After Downloading

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
This will allow the app to download all other packages need to run the app correctly.

## Running the App
### Starting the server
Run `node backed/server.js` from the project directory to start the server.

### Starting the App
Then `npm start` from the project directory to start the app.
